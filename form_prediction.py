"""
This is a file that will help you convert your individual predictions to the final prediction. 
In the same directory as this file, you should have the following 4 files:
  - LF_test_labels.csv - with at least two columns, 'id' and 'LF'
  - LH_test_labels.csv - with at least two columns, 'id' and 'LH'
  - RF_test_labels.csv - with at least two columns, 'id' and 'RF'
  - RH_test_labels.csv - with at least two columns, 'id' and 'RH'

Running this script will convert these four files into a single CSV file, submission.csv, by
mutating the IDs so that they also include the leg that is being checked.
